In 2004 the **Cassini spacecraft** arrived at Saturn. For the next 13 years the mission collected the largest ever, amount of data on Saturn's magnetic and space environment (magnetosphere). Due to Cassini,**Saturn is now the second most observed magnetosphere after that of Earth** and many of our previous expectations about the Saturn environment have been overturned from this data deluge. These **unique datasets allow for the first large-scale statistical analyses** of how mass moves around Saturn. It is now understood that a **Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) like instabilities**, called interchange, are instrumental in these processes by exchanging different plasma populations around Saturn. Saturn, and other giant magnetospheres, provide some of the best observations of these instabilities in a naturally evolving system allowing important studies that help **fill in our understanding of transport around planetary bodies**.
