<p> As part of my teaching and research, I enjoy developing techniques for data intensive visualizations for space and geosciences. 
  This page includes some current projects I am working on.  </p>


<h1>3D Interactive Mars Magnetic Environments</h1>

<p>If you have difficulty loading the interactive graphic please see a screenshot at the bottom of the page. </p>

<p> About: The data included in this image represent the magnetic field of Mars courtesy of the MAVEN mission team <a href="https://lasp.colorado.edu/maven/sdc/public/">Science Data Center</a>.
  The colored lines represent magnetic field line traces started at 500 km above the surface. This orientation represents the sun overhead at 180 deg. longitude and a westward solar wind magnetic field. 
  The colors on the surface represent the estimation of crustal fields as calculated from <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JE005854"> Langlais et al., 2019</a>.
  This graphic is a work in progress attempting to reconstruct a 3D dataset from spatio-temporal planetary mission data. 
  This does not represnt a physical model but measured data, as a result of the statistical averaging of these data the magnetic field lines do not follow Maxwell's equations.</p>
  
<p> Resources: This interactive Mars is powered by <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>. 
  The development of this visualization was assisted by material from the <a href="https://nordicesmhub.github.io/deep_python/index.html">Python for Dynamics and Evolution of Earth 
  and Planets</a> and SQLite. </p>

<p> About: This graphic was published in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JA025391">JGR Space Physics</a>. It details
  the agreement between several different statistical surveys of plasma transport events around Saturn. It is built on the 
  <a href="http://circos.ca/">Circos tool</a>, see original tool citation <a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2009/06/15/gr.092759.109.abstract.">here</a>. </p> -->
