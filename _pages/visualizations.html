<p> As part of my teaching and research, I enjoy developing techniques for data intensive visualizations for space and geosciences. 
  This page includes some current projects I am working on.  </p>


<h1>3D Interactive Mars Space Environments</h1>

<p> About: This represents a orbit of the MAVEN mission over Mars (grey) and the average bowshock location at noon local time (black) over the dayside. 
  The surface is the elevation as estimated from the Mars Global Surveyor's Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter instrument. 
  This was the orbital arrangement of the MAVEN spacecraft and planet on December 27, 2022. </p>
  
<p> Resources: This interactive Mars is powered by <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>. 
  The development of this visualization was assisted by material from the <a href="https://nordicesmhub.github.io/deep_python/index.html">Python for Dynamics and Evolution of Earth 
  and Planets</a> and SQLite. The MOLA surface data is described within Zuber et al., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/92JE00341">1992</a>.
  The average bowshock is calculated from Gruesbeck et al., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JA025366">2018</a>.</p>
