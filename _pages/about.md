My research is focused on nanotechnology, specifically on **modeling charge transport in nanoscale devices**. My intrests include atomistic modeling of nanoscale devices and materials, Modeling quantum electron transport in DNA and biomolecules, Molecular electronics, and device physics. I use density functional theory calculations combined with Green's function formalism to conduct my studies.

My approach utilizies:
- **Atomistic Modeling**: Structure optimization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations using software like [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/), [SIESTA](https://siesta-project.org/siesta/About/overview.html), [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/info/about/), and [AMBER](https://ambermd.org/index.php).
- **Coding**: writing codes and developing algorithms to calculate charge transport properties of nanoscale devices, using MATLAB or Python.
- **3D Vizualisation**: to view atomic structures and devices, [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD) or GaussView
