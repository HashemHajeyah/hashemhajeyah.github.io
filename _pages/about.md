I am a **planetary scientist and space physicist** at the University of California, Berkeley where I am a post-doctoral scholar in the Space Sciences Laboratory ([SSL](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/)). I am passionate about developing statistical techniques to enable data-driven discovery for space and planetary sciences. My work intersects space physics and planetary science, with techniques from **statistics**, **data visualization**, and **computer science**. 

Most of my work focuses on understanding current **planetary environments**, and their previous conditions, by studying newly available large datasets from  planetary missions. My current research is focused on analyzing spacecraft data to understand current and past planetary conditions on **Mars**. My recent work, as part of my [PhD thesis](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/155251) supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a NASA Earth and Space Sciences Fellowship focused on developing **interpretable methods for machine learning** in planetary science with applications to plasma transport around **Saturn**. 

I am interested in supporting the use of statistical and large-data methods for science and developing education in these practices. These efforts have included co-creating the Machine Learning for Planetary Space Physics [seminar series](https://ml4psp.github.io/), leading a community generated white [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15129) for **incorporting machine learning in planetary science for the next decade** of missions, and serving on the Planetary Data Ecosystem Independent Review [Board](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-establishes-board-to-review-planetary-data-ecosystem/) Subcomittee on Mining and Automation. Additionally, I have co-developed a **geoscience visualization and statistics** [course](https://github.com/abbyazari/data_vis_statistics_geosciences) for physical science students new to computer programming which received an [award](https://crlte.engin.umich.edu/towner-prize-winners/abigail-azari/) from the University of Michigan for oustanding instruction.
