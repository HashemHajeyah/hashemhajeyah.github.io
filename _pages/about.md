I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://kuweb.ku.edu.kw/COEP/EngineeringPrograms/ElecEng/index.htm) at Kuwait University. My research is in nanotechnology, primarily focused on **Theory and Modeling charge transport in nanoscale devices**. My interests include atomistic modeling of nanoscale devices and materials, Modeling quantum electron transport in DNA and biomolecules, Molecular electronics, and device physics. To study the electrical properties of nanoscale devices, I use quantum mechanical methods such as density functional theory and apply Green's function formalism to calculate charge transport properties.

My approach utilizies:
- **Atomistic Modeling**: Structure optimization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations using software like [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/), [SIESTA](https://siesta-project.org/siesta/About/overview.html), [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/info/about/), and [AMBER](https://ambermd.org/index.php).
- **Coding**: writing codes and developing algorithms to calculate charge transport properties of nanoscale devices, using MATLAB or Python.
- **3D Vizualisation**: to view atomic structures and devices, [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD) or GaussView
