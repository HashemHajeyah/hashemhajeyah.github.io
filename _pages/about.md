My research is focused on nanotechnology, specifically in **modeling charge transport in nanoscale devices**. My intrests include atomistic modeling of nanoscale devices and materials, Modeling quantum electron transport in DNA and biomolecules, Molecular electronics, and device physics. I use density functional theory calculations combined with Green's function formalism to conduct my studies.

Most of my work requires:
- **Atomistic Modeling**: Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using packages like Gaussian, SIESTA, and VASP.
- **Coding**: writing codes and developing algorithms to calculate charge transport properties of nanoscale devices, using MATLAB or Python.
- **3D Vizualisation**: to view atomic structures and devices, [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD) or GaussView
