I am a post-doctoral scholar at the University of California: Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL). At SSL I work to analyze spacecraft data to find our what the historical remnants of Mars' magnetic field might tell us about the loss of Mars' atmosphere. I work at the intersection of applying data science to analyze large amounts of in-situ and remote sensing data to answer fundamental questions about planetary environments. I am passionate about developing statistical techniques for enabling scientific discovery in space and planetary sciences, especially for supervised classification tasks. Previously, to my graduate education at the  University of Michigan I worked in science policy where I provided policy analysis and technical support to federal agencies on a variety of topics including climate data, STEM education, and space policy. Check out publications for my most recent work. Earlier work may be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UdcGQbYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

## Active Projects

- evaluation of using Jupyter notebooks for teaching to develop a growth mindset based course on geoscience visualization and statistics (see [Teaching](https://astro-abby.github.io/teaching/)),
- understanding transport, loss, and energization of energetic ions around Saturn through large-scale statistics
- characterizing Mars' historical magnetic field to understand its previous atmospheric loss

<!-- I am collaborating on the following: 
- analysis of solar wind composition using machine learning to investigate plasma dynamics using ion abundances. Project Lead: [Yeimy Rivera](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/yeimy-rivera/)
- analysis of mass transport and evolution of high energy particle events around Saturn. Project Lead: [Prof. Michael Liemohn](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/michael-liemohn/) -->

### Saturn's Mass Transport

In 2004 the Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn. For the next 13 years the mission collected the largest ever, amount of data on Saturn's magnetic and space environment. Due to Cassini, Saturn is now the second most observed magnetosphere after that of Earth and many of our previous expectations about the Saturn environment have been overturned from this data deluge, from the role the largest moon, Titan, plays in the system to the rotational rate of the planet itself.

These unique datasets allow for the first large-scale statistical analyses, and new pictures, of how mass moves around Saturn to be developed. It is now understood that around the planet, a Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) like instability, called interchange, is instrumental in moving plasma around the planet. Interchange instabilities exchange different plasma populations around Saturn. RT instabilities are ubiqutious in the universe and can be observed in as simple of a system as pouring milk into coffee to in astrophysical nebulae and fusion reactors. Saturn, and other giant magnetospheres, provide some of the best observational locations to study these instabilities in a naturally evolving system. Researching these processes greatly improves knowledge of planetary magnetospheres and contributes to comparative studies of potentially habitable planets and [space weather risks](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/spaceweather/en/) at Earth.
