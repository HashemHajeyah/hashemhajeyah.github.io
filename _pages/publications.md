*This work provides an example of interpretable machine learning for the field of planetary space physics along with a guide for future applications of machine learning to space physics problems. Within the Machine Learning in Heliophysics collection.  Preview accesible at  <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2020.00036/abstract"> Frontiers</a>.* 

### 2019

**Azari, A. R.**, Jia, X., Liemohn, M. W., Hospodarsky, G. B., Provan, G., Ye, S. ‐Y., et al. (2019). "Are Saturn's Interchange Injections Organized by Rotational Longitude?"Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, 124. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA026196

*This work investigated if mass transport events most similar to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in Saturn’s space environment were related to ionospheric or upper atmopsheric conditions. To complete this work we undertook a large-scale data occurrence analyses to tease apart multiple dependencies.

### 2018

Regoli, L. H., Roussos, E., Dialynas, K., Luhmann, J. G., Sergis, N., Jia, X., Román, D., **Azari, A. R.**, Krupp, N., Jones, G., Coates, A., and Rae, I. (2018). "Statistical study of the energetic proton environment at Titan'ss orbit from the Cassini spacecraft." Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, 123, 4820–4834. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA025442

*This work produces a statistical study of the proton environment around Titan, the largest Saturnian moon. Can be found online at: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA025442"> JGR Space Physics</a>.*

**Azari, A. R.**, Liemohn, M. W., Jia, X., Thomsen, M. F., Mitchell, D. G., Sergis, N., et al. (2018). "Interchange injections at Saturn: Statistical survey of energetic H+ sudden flux intensifications." Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, 123, 4692–4711. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA025391

*Featured article in July 2018 for novel interdisciplinary visualizations. The work within this paper developed a physics-based method most similar to logistic regression to rank and classify transient of energetic material around Saturn (interchange injections). This created the first standardized comparison to several statistical surveys undertaken to understand the transport of mass around Saturn.
