  *This paper represents a community of 16 co-authors and 32 co-signers and our recommendations for machine learning in planetary science to funding agencies and the planetary community. It summarizes current efforts in the field in machine learning applied to planetary science, and compares this to other fields in the natural sciences. It concludes with recommendations in the next decade for supporting a data-rich future for planetary science.

  *This work details a process to include physical knowledge in planetary and space physics machine learning models, before demonstrating that this inclusion increases the interpretability of models for scientific knowledge gain. Within the Machine Learning in Heliophysics collection.*


### Planetary Systems Plasma Transport - Terrestrial Planets

* **Azari, A. R.**, Mitchell, D., Xu, S. (in prep) "The Draped Magnetic Field of Mars - Influence of Crustal Fields and Solar Wind"

  *This work details a large-scale data-driven evaluation of Mars' magnetic field response to the solar wind at low altitudes with MAVEN spacecraft data. This work was presented at AGU 2020.*

* Dewey, R. M., Slavin, J., Raines, J., **Azari, A. R.**, and Sun, W. (2020) "MESSENGER observations of flow braking and flux pileup of dipolarizations in Mercury's magnetotail: Evidence for current wedge formation" Acessible at the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JA028112"> Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics</a>

  *This paper performed an automated identification of plasma transport in Mercury's magnetic environment to compare this system to that of Earth's. In analyzing transport events, this work found that a small fraction of events reached the nightside surface, which has implications for surface space weathering.*

### Planetary Systems Plasma Transport - Outer Planets

  *This work estimates the speed at which plasma is traveling toward Saturn, an essential number required to calculate system wide transport.*

*This paper represents the outer planets community's scientific motivation for sending a major mission to the Neptune system in the near future. Neptune, to date, has never had an orbiting spacecraft. A mission to Neptune would advance cross-disciplinary planetary science, including: geologic studies for Triton, considering Neptune as a class of discovered exoplanets, and plasma transport studies. For plasma transport, Neptune has large non-dipolar magnetic fields, complicating our currently understood system. Such a mission would represent the next several decades, given the time scale required for these missions, of scientific progress for these exotic planetary systems, and understanding mass transport at the icy giants.*

  *This work demonstrates the limited influence of the upper atmosphere on interchange through systematically evaluating previous statistical studies over different sampling regimes.*

*This paper developed a new standardized, and automated, physics based identification method for interchange most similar to logistic regression, and used this to understand the statistical distributions of events. A figure in this paper was featured in the journal for its novel use of visualizations from other data-rich fields (genomics).*


### Inclusive Computational Geoscience Education

* **Azari, A. R.** (2020) "A Data-Driven Understanding of Plasma Transport in Saturn's Magnetic Environment" Ph.D. Thesis. University of Michigan. Acessible at the <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/155251"> DeepBlue Thesis Database </a>

*The appendix of this work discusses the implementation of Jupyter notebooks to provide an approachable experience for students into computation in a course for undergraduate and graduate students. We found that Jupyter notebooks naturally provided instructors to embrace a growth mindset style of learning by allowing students to attempt, and retry solutions. It also allowed instructors to grade computational assignments for partial credit, reinforcing a growth minded approach to student learning by the instructional team. This work was presented at <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Jupiter_with_Jupyter/11691783AGU"> AGU in 2019 </a>. Brian Swiger, Alex Shane, Drs. Liemohn and Huang-Saad, and myself are currently in the process of finalizing our assessment for submission to the Journal of Geoscience Education.*
