I enjoy weaving visualization methods into the courses I teach as a way to explore physical science concepts. The following are a selection of data-intensive courses which I have developed and taught.

### Space Sciences Lab Research Experience for Undergraduates Bootcamp
- Undergraduate REU bootcamp in visualization, hosted on [JupytEarth Hub](https://hub.jupytearth.org/) in 2021 at [github/abbyazari/ASSURE-REU](https://github.com/abbyazari/ASSURE-REU)


### Data Visualization and Statistics in Geosciences 2018-2019
- Undergraduate / Graduate course at University of Michigan, 2018-2019 at [github/abbyazari](https://github.com/abbyazari/data_vis_statistics_geosciences), 2020+ at [github/clasp423](https://github.com/clasp423/data_vis_statistics_geosciences)


### Interdisciplinary Committee on Organizational Studies (ICOS) Big Data Summer Camp 2018
- Graduate course at University of Michigan through the Ross School of Business, 2018 at [ICOS Big Data Camp 2018](https://icosbigdatacamp.github.io/2018-summer-camp/), other years at [ICOS Big Data Camp](https://icosbigdatacamp.github.io). Developed visualization sections.

I have additionally contributed to the teaching teams in various physical science courses including in rocket science, thermodynamics, and introductory undergraduate physics.
