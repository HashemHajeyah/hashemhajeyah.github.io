When estimating the rotation rate of Jupiter and Saturn scientists often use a periodic signal of radio emission from the planet's auroral region. At Saturn this emission is called the Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR) and unlike Jupiter, the period of SKR is observed to vary over time. Similar periodic variations have also been observed in particle energy and magnetic fields, suggesting that this periodicity is a fundamental property of the Saturn space environment. In this work, we ask if these same repetitions can be seen in a process called interchange injection. To do this we analyze interchange's occurrence rate, as observed in particle data from the Cassini spacecraft, with respect to two longitude systems previously derived from the observed periods of the SKR emission. We find that interchange occurrence shows only weak organization in these longitude systems as compared to organization by local time.
