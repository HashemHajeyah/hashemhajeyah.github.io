collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018_5_31
excerpt: 'A statistical study of the energetic proton environment at Titan&apos;s orbit as captured by the MIMI/LEMMS and MIMI/CHEMS instruments is performed...ion fluxes reveals a weak asymmetry in Saturn local time with the highest fluxes occurring in the premidnight sector of the magnetosphere...This model can be used to better understand the interaction of Titan with the magnetosphere and the energy deposition by energetic particles below the main ionospheric peak.'
