title: "Are Saturn's Interchange Injections Organized by Rotational Longitude?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018_5_31
excerpt: 'When estimating the rotation rate of Jupiter and Saturn scientists often use a periodic signal of radio emission...we analyze interchange&apos;s occurrence rate, as observed in particle data from the Cassini spacecraft, with respect to two longitude systems...We find that interchange occurrence shows only weak organization in these longitude systems as compared to organization by local time.'
