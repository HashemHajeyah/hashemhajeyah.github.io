As part of the undergraduate curriculum I co-developed and taught a 4 credit course for winter 2018 and 2019 for data visualization and statistics for climate and space scientists. We focus on developing comfort and competency in programming and presenting geosphysical analysis in Python. All the laboratory sessions are posted online.
