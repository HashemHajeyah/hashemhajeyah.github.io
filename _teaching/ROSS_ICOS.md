Lecturer for a week long intensive course in data science. 

Course Description: Social and organizational life are increasingly conducted or tracked online through electronic media, from emails to Twitter feed to dating sites to GPS phone tracking. The traces these activities leave behind have acquired the (misleading) title of “big data.” It is a good bet that within a few years, a standard part of graduate training in the social sciences will include a hefty dose of “how to make use of big data,” just as statistical analysis is a standard part of such training today. The ICOS Big Data Camp aims to make big data accessible for people with no prior background. We want people to leave with enough confidence and basic knowledge to be able to know what is possible in their research and where they might go next, drawing on resources at the University of Michigan.
